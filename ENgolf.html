                New R Performance torque vector control creates a more dynamic and fun driving experience <br> <br>

                <strong> Golf R has traditionally been the most powerful model of this best-selling car. </strong>
                <br> <br>
                Featuring all-wheel drive and the most exclusive design and the most exclusive equipment, this extremely dynamic car represents the top standard of technology in its class - Golf class. And this time things are no different: Golf R is the first Volkswagen launched with a completely new all-wheel drive system: 4MOTION with R-Performance torque vector control. This system, intelligently interconnected by the vehicle's dynamic settings, makes new dimensions of sportiness possible. <br> <br>
                
                "Our goal for the Golf R has been to make its driving characteristics as neutral as possible. In other words, we want to make sure that the car does not understeer or overturn - it must be as easy to control as possible at all times." explains Jonas Thielebein, the engineer who handles the Golf R. As a developer of Volkswagen R, he is especially proud of the torque vector control system. Here, a new final rear transmission distributes power not only between the front and rear axles, but also between the two rear wheels. Thus, the agility of the Golf R model is significantly improved, especially when approaching corners. "Selective wheel torque control allows you to push the car to new limits. Even at high speeds, the car's handling remains as neutral as possible," adds Thielebein. <br> <br>
                
                <strong> R Performance package </strong>
                <br> <br>
                The Golf R model can also be ordered with an optional R Performance package, which increases the top speed to 270 km / h in this case. The R Performance package also includes a larger, prominent rear spoiler for increased aerodynamic pressure on the rear axle, 19-inch wheels with Estoril design and two additional travel profiles, "Special" (Nürburgring mode) and "Drift". Selecting the travel profile can be done quickly by pressing the R button on the steering wheel.
                <br> <br>
                 
                
                <strong> Two travel profiles for maximum performance </strong>
                <br> <br>
                
                Away from public roads, Drift offers a whole new level of driving dynamics and maximizes the potential for torque vector control by overtaking instead of neutral maneuverability: the maximum possible torque in this mode is available for the wheel outside the turn. The ESC system is set to "Sport" as standard in Drift mode, which means that the Golf R's control electronics come in as late as possible. However, real drifts are also possible: all you have to do is set the ESC to OFF to deactivate it.
                <br> <br> <br>
                 
                
                <strong> More driver control </strong>
                <br> <br>
                In both travel profiles of the R Performance package, the accelerator pedal features have been sensitively adjusted to create an unaltered sense of performance. This high level of control is an advantage when it comes to perfect drifting on snow and ice or on asphalt. In both Special and Drift modes, the gearbox calibration for the 420 Nm has been optimized to keep speeds constant. In automatic mode, the dual-clutch gearbox (DSG) shifts up and down as late as possible and down as quickly as possible, which contributes to the development of power.
                <br> <br> <br>
                 
                
                For the first time since the introduction of the DSG, the gearbox will remain in manual mode for both modes, if the driver has chosen this. Unintentional switching back to automatic mode is a thing of the past. This is something that professionals like Benjamin Leuchter have been waiting for for a long time. As the brand ambassador and test and development pilot at Volkswagen, Leuchter has made a significant contribution to the development and fine-tuning of the Golf R. "My verdict is clear: the Golf R is the exceptional model in this product line! with its all-wheel drive and perfect two-wheel drive, the Golf R offers an incomparably fun driving experience. "

                A wide range of snow and ice drifting images is available in the Volkswagen Newsroom download area. In addition, the Golf R Winter Challenge can be viewed on the Volkswagen and Volkswagen R channels. In this unique series of videos, Benjamin Leuchter and Swiss rally driver Jasmin Preisig face off at the wheel of the Golf R.
