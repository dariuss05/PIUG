                <strong> Wolfsburg - In April, Volkswagen unveiled the latest stage of evolution of the sixth generation Polo. Now the sportiest version of it is launched: the new Polo GTI. The wearer of the legendary acronym leads the Polo segment, in terms of performance, technology and sportiness. The powerful TSI engine and sports chassis, specially adapted for the Polo GTI, turn the best-selling compact car into a dynamic and sporty four-door car, which also allows semi-automatic driving as an option, for the first time in the Polo GTI. As the owner of the latest assistance systems, it guarantees even greater comfort and safety for all passengers. </strong> <br> <br>

                <strong> Set new benchmarks in the compact car segment: the new Polo GTI. </strong>
                <br> <br>
               
               In the automotive world, there are three letters with a magic effect, already five decades ago: GTI. Ever since the original GTI in 1976, Volkswagen has made sure that this code is synonymous with the extraordinary driving pleasure of the compact segment. Polo has been acronym GTI since 1998 - the third model to do so, after the Golf and Scirocco. The latest generation perfectly illustrates the GTI tradition and sets new benchmarks for compact cars. The technical basis for this is the Modular Transverse Toolkit (MQB) platform from Volkswagen. For all model lines, MQB means technological progress, high body rigidity, extremely low weight and very good impact properties.
               <br> <br>
               
               IQ.DRIVE Travel Assist, first used in the Polo GTI, facilitates semi-automatic driving. The system is capable of taking the steering, braking and acceleration of the new Polo GTI, from 0 km / h to the Travel Assist control limit (210 km / h). For longitudinal guidance, IQ.DRIVE Travel Assist uses well-known systems such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). Longitudinal guidance is supported by Lane Assist, which is part of the standard equipment. The driver can activate the system from the Travel Assist button on the leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel with a new design. The driver's hands must remain on the steering wheel while using the system, which means that the driver is always responsible for the car.
               
                
               
               <strong> Sportiness associated with efficiency and moderate consumption </strong>
               <br> <br>
               
               The heart of a GTI is always the engine. Like all its predecessors, the new Polo GTI always has front-wheel drive. The direct-injection petrol turbo engine shifts gears with a standard seven-speed dual-clutch (DSG) transmission. The main components of the turbo engine in the new Polo GTI, which is mounted transversely to the front of the car, are features such as a dual injection system with direct combined injection and in the fuel gallery, an engine control unit with four main processors and an electronic valve lift system on the intake side. Although it has a high efficiency, the engine is impressively efficient with moderate fuel consumption. The light weight of the new Polo GTI contributes to this. <br> <br>
               
               As expected from a true Volkswagen GTI, the new Polo GTI is equipped as standard with a sports chassis, specially designed for the car. Thus, the chassis is lower by 15 millimeters and guarantees the typical GTI synthesis between driving dynamics, safe neutrality and a high degree of driving comfort. <br> <br>
               
               Noul Polo GTI este echipat acum standard cu faruri IQ.Light - LED matrix și o bandă iluminată pe grila radiatorului, ca optimizare distinctivă a luminilor de zi. Astfel noul Polo este văzut ca formând o punte stilistică spre modelele complet electrice ID. de la Volkswagen, iar la noua generație de modele de succes precum Golf, Arteon și Tiguan, care de asemenea au în dotare această bandă luminoasă și uimitoare de leduri, tipică pentru noile mașini Volkswagen, este ca opțiune sau în funcție de linia de dotare. <br><br>
               
               The most visible aesthetic transformation of the new Polo GTI is the completely new LED rear light block with animated brake lights and integrated dynamic indicators, which indicate the change of direction through the movement of light fluxes. The new GTI-specific bumper makes the compact sports car an even more dominant and visible presence on the road. The Adaptive Front Lighting (AFS) system, integrated into the side of the bumper and controlled by the high beam headlights, has been redesigned and now provides an even clearer lighting effect. In combination with the IQ.Light - LED matrix headlights, it ensures very uniform lighting of the road and its surroundings. The red GTI logo, extremely visible on the radiator grille, the honeycomb-shaped ventilation grilles and the continuous red band above the LED daytime running lights remain the emblematic features of the GTI at the front of the car. On the left and right, the lane flows towards the IQ.Light headlights - LED matrix with red wings.

               <br> <br> <br> <br>
                
               
               The new Polo GTI is available in five colors: Deep Black Pearl Effect, Smoke Gray Metallic, Kings Red Metallic, Pure White Uni, and Reef Blue Metallic. The last three body colors can be combined with a contrasting black ceiling as an option (ceiling package). The car is equipped as standard with 17-inch aluminum wheels. Polo GTI can also be ordered with 18-inch aluminum wheels.
               <br> <br>
               Inside, the dominant colors are black, red, gray and chrome surfaces.
               Ceiling pillars and ceiling upholstery are always kept in Titanium Black, typical for GTI. Contrasting red stitches are also, as always, a typical feature of a GTI. The aesthetics are complemented by the multifunctional, leather-wrapped sports steering wheel, which is part of the standard equipment, the shift lever trim and the seat surfaces. The beats sound system, with 300 W and six speakers, creates a captivating acoustic experience. The amplifier is installed under the floor, in the variable cargo area, to save space. The trunk capacity of the new Polo GTI is 351 liters. <br> <br>
               
               All equipment details are valid for the German market. Approved values for consumption and CO2 emissions are not yet available. The car is not yet available for sale.
